My name is Markus and I am a open source enthusiast since 2008 ✨.

I am the developer behind [cs2pr](https://staabm.github.io/2022/04/03/annotate-pull-request-from-checkstyle.html), [phpstan-dba](https://staabm.github.io/2022/05/01/phpstan-dba.html), [rexstan](https://staabm.github.io/2022/06/18/rexstan-REDAXO-AddOn.html) and a few more projects.

For fun and educating myself I actively contribute to various projects - [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/pulls?q=is%3Amerged+author%3Astaabm), [filp/whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops), [sabre/dav](https://github.com/sabre-io/dav), [stomp-php](https://github.com/stomp-php/stomp-php), [propelorm](https://github.com/propelorm) - to name a few of them.

I am curious and reading a lot regarding latest web technologies, web standards and browser development. My passion is working on performance problems and figuring out crazy bugs 🐜.
